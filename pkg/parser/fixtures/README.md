# Parser Fixtures

Collection of random "real world" test TSCN files I've collected from the internet. There is a comment at the top
which contains a link from where the file is.

## Ignored files

Files prefixed by an underscore ("_") are ignored in integration tests. This exists mostly to have files that
are not supported yet and might not for a while, but should.
